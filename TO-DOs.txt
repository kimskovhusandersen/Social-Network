A list of users online:
To get the socket ID, which will be helpful to send "live" messages.
Notices! One user can have multiple sockets open at once (multiple tabs, phone, etc.)
But one user, can only have one socket connection per tab, so only attach event listeners once!

Make a list of socketIds and userIds:
{
    LKJSKDA343098Jkj: 5,
    LKJSKDA343098Jkj: 5
}

We will get the user's id from the request object sent in the "Handshake".


To send a "message" to everybody, use io.emit("Hi everybody!") or io.socket.emit("Hi everybody!")
To send a "message" to everybody, but one, use socket.broadcast.emit("Hi there") // this sends it to everybody, but 'this' socket (socket.broadcast)

If you scale (using cluster or have multiple servers), use reddis and make sure that node has the same instance of socket. Perhaps make sure
that only one server is hosting the socket.
